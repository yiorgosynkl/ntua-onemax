    "Find the binary sequence $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ that maximizes the sum $x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n, n = 20$. Analyze the effect of population size, crossover probability, and mutation probability on the quality of the solution (how close it is to the obvious optimal solution) derived from the genetic algorithm. Specifically, change the population from $10$ to $100$ chromosomes with a step of $10$, the probability of crossing from $0.3$ to $0.9$ with a step of $0.1$, and the chance of mutation from $0.01$ to $0.2$ with a step of $0.01$. Examine the quality of the genetic algorithm solution as you change the parameters. Elitism can be used if you wish."

    "The core logic:\n",
    "- we use an optimisation techinique to find the best solution for a problem by trying to combine different good solutions and introducing some variations. Through iteration we converge to set solutions that cannot become any better.\n",
    "In nature, according to the theory of natural evolution and the concept of \"the survival of the fittest\", the individuals that have a better combination of genetical characteristics (\"fittest\") are more likely to reproduce and thus each generation is more likely to acquire the characteristics of the fittest.\n",

    "In genetic algorithms, we start with a set of solutions (population). Each solution (chromosome) is a representation of a possible solution to a our problem. The representation is problem specific. Usually we use a string of characters or an array of integers. Each element of a solution is called a gene. With the survival of the fittest and  iteration, genes that constitute a good solution are more likely to be part of the final solution whereas genes that constitute a bad solution are more likely to disappear during the iterative method.\n",
    "The core elements are:\n",
    "- selection (depends on the fitness function)\n",
